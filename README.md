# ATBS File Sorter
--- 

This program looks at all the files and then creates a new folder for each unique extentsion (.txt, .html, etc.) and copies the file to the correct folder.

I wanted to make this one to practice moving files and also I was trying to find files with the .xlsx extentsion but their was a lot of files and I didn't find out until after this if you right-click there is a sort button.

Still a cool idea to seperate by extentsion type into their respective folder.
